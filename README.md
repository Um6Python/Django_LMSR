So, first. We need to go over Hypermind. And contrast it against LMSRs. 

We will then explain the different components that are incorporated into an LMSR. 

And then we will explain each of them in detail. 1st we will go into CDAs. CDAs are continuous double auctions. That represents the first kind of prediction markets. Hypermind, for instance. In a continuous double auction, whenever someone Wants to buy a certain number of shares at a certain price, that auction goes into the order book as a bid. Concurrently. If you have shares that you want to sell. Then those shares go into the ask. Or they are recorded as asks. When you bid on a specific price for a specific number of shares that is less than or equal to the one in an ask for the same price then you match and the transaction, or rather the continuous double auction proceeds. look at here underline last. 

 

LMSRs On the other hand Do not rely on This concept of CDAs but rather it relies on a key concept. Which are automated market makers or AMMs for short. 

One massive downfall in the CDA is that there is no liquidity. You can only buy shares that are being sold by other bidders. 

LMSRs introduces an AMM, in it, the market performs the opposite of all trades. 

Because of that, LMSRs could only be used with play money because using real money would result in having lost to the system. And no one wants the system to lose. Especially not the system makers. 

In hypermind, to bootstrap a 2-answer market, one user needs to buy shares, and the market simulates the “bid” of the same amount on the other outcome. 

The LMSR bootstraps differently, initiating all outcomes with the same probability: 1/n.
